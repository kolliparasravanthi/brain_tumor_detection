🧠 Brain Tumor Detection

This project is a deep-learning–based application that classifies brain MRI images into four classes. It uses a CNN model to analyze MRI scans and detect different tumor types with good accuracy.

📁 Dataset Information

The dataset contains four categories:

Glioma

Meningioma

Pituitary

Notumor


MRI images are preprocessed before model training.


---

🔄 Project Workflow

1. Load and preprocess the dataset


2. Build CNN model


3. Train and validate the model


4. Plot accuracy and loss


5. Predict on new MRI images
